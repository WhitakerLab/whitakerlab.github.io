I wasn't available for our first meeting of 2020 - I was instructing at the [Advanced Methods for Reproducible Science](https://osf.io/gupxv/) workshop in Windsor Park.
We all caught up remotely though, and Louise chaired the meeting to share some of the fun we had over the holidays, and our plans for the new year.
I hope you enjoy all the updates, they were great fun and really inspirational for me to read through!

## Celebrations and cool things to share

**Kirstie** shared an update that makes her smile: the lab's use of HackMD for these meetings will be featured in an article on collaborative writing in Nature (update: [here it is](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/three-ways-to-collaborate-on-writing)!)

She had a wonderful holiday.
She read two books, one fiction (The Librarian, fine but not amazing) and one about community building ([Towards Collective Liberation: Anti-Racist Organizing, Feminist Praxis, and Movement Building Strategy](https://www.pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_detail&p=518), absolutely loved it), watched two great movies ([Three Identical Strangers](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/three-identical-strangers/episode-guide/) (try not to look up too much about the film before you watch it!) and [The Guilty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abaoKA6rn5k)), and just generally lounged around and relaxed a lot.

**Kirstie** shared that the deadline for _The Turing Way_ Book Dash 📚💨 is coming up on **16 Jan** and asked lab members to promote the event to their networks.
  * There's a tweet thread with lots of helpful information to share: [https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1210934696248586241?s=20](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1210934696248586241?s=20)
  * And the application form: [https://forms.gle/8uZh6t4nQFbi6zSM8](https://forms.gle/8uZh6t4nQFbi6zSM8)

There's also a _Turing Way_ [Collaboration Cafe](https://hackmd.io/@KirstieJane/CollabCafe) on **15 Jan** that **Malvika** will host.

**Malvika** was away for 1.5 months.
She spent the first month in India, mostly working on two EMBO conferences.
She found it a great experience and even found time to visit family, and take a short trip to Kerala in South India before heading back to Ireland for Christmas.
Malvika spent Christmas time relaxing, walking in the cold Irish sites/woods, Sudoku-ing and reading books: [Emperor of all Maladies: an autobiography of cancer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer/dp/0007250924) ("an excellent book"), [Norwegian Woods](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Norwegian-Wood-Haruki-Murakami/dp/0099448823) ("would have given up reading that if I had other fictions to read"), one short poetry book on Leonard Cohen, and finally by [21 lessons for 21st century](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/1784708283/) by Yuval Noah Harrari.
She watched Paddington 2 with nephews and nieces - multiple times ("such a great movie").

**Patricia** was mainly lazy over the Christmas period focussing on ignoring work emails and reading/audiobooks/podcasts (finally caught up with the [Guilty Feminist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Guilty-Feminist-noble-goals-hypocrisies/dp/0349010129) as an audiobook - "sooo good"), jigsaws and watching Netflix: [The Witcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(TV_series)), [The Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)), [The Irishman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1302006/) and all the John Wick movies!
(Her main review was that they "should all have been 30 minutes shorter" 😂).

**Louise** had a lovely relaxing break without much laptop time, so she's feeling rather refreshed going into the New Year 😄
She's trying to limit the amount of new stuff going into our flat as the shelves are at risk of overflowing, so there are only two new books for her this year.
Both are about British history.
Louise stopped learning history at school when she was 14, so she's attempting to fill her knowledge gap!

**Louise** also shared this paper "Development, calibration, and validation of a novel human ventricular myocyte model in health, disease, and drug block" (doi: [10.7554/eLife.48890](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48890) [preprint](https://elifesciences.org/articles/48890)).
("For those of you more into neurons than cardiomyocytes, think Hodgkin-Huxley equations+++.")
The paper itself is interesting, but what she really wanted to point out is this [blog](https://underlid.blogspot.com/2019/12/welcomedear-reader.html) that 1st author Jakub Tomek published alongside the paper.
It gives so much extra detail!
It would be great if more authors did this sort of thing.

**Sarah's** Christmas mostly revolved around pajamas, dogs and cross-stitching!
She really needed this break as she felt [very low on spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory) at the end of 2019.
So much so that she missed her bus to Hull! 😂 😭

**Yo** took a break on the Bank Holiday days, but worked all the other days and found it really relaxing.
There was no one else working so she was able to get her head down and actually accomplish quite a bit! (Normally coding in the office is almost impossible due to interruptions, so this ended up being quite special, despite some unsquishable bugs in the code!).

> I've been reading [Thornfruit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38488075-thornfruit) by Felicia Davin.
> I'm partway through book three in less than a week because it was so darn awesome:
> * Set in a tide-locked world where half the planet is day, half night, and humans live in the little habitable belt in the middle
> * Magic is a thing
> * Obvious gender equality and no gender roles to speak of
> * Lots of LGBTQ+ goodness
> * Characters that are real and flawed and lovable

**Yini** had a 'working Christmas', but she's looking forward to visiting Tromsø in Norway for the aurora lights this weekend!

**Ang** had a wonderful Christmas in London and worked productively for most of the time.
The Boxing Day sales were particularly successful, and he thought the New Year Fireworks looked great! 🎆🎇✨

**Anastasia** spent the holidays in London, cooking lots of meals for family, going on long winter walks, and making Russian dumplings on New Years Eve.

**Georgia** has been in Scotland staying with my family, enjoying lots of recuperating rest!
It's very serene up there, she has crowds of sheep to weave through rather than people on her morning run 😄
Georgia has been reading (and loving) Ursula le Guin.
She's been semi-switched on to working: revising a paper and planning for the year ahead!
She's also been enjoying this (very basic 😄) [course on neuroscience](https://www.edx.org/xseries/harvardx-fundamentals-of-neuroscience) which she's hoping will give her some more grounding to join in more of the amazing topics that come up in lab meetings!

## Questions we're thinking about

**Kirstie** asked what everyone's New Year's resolutions were?
They're listed at the end of this blog post 💖

**Patricia** is wondering how to set realistic goals?
Its so hard to get the balance right 😞

Some of the lab suggestions included:

* Divide your goals into short term (weekly and monthly) and how/where they help your long term goals.
  It's always a good idea to have the most important goals to be the priority, and be ok with dropping a few things (or moving them to later in the year).
* Where possible, break down the specifics of your plans.
  Small chunks allow for accurate estimates.
  Point 5 of this (nearly 20 year old!) article ["Painless Software Schedules"](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/03/29/painless-software-schedules/) sums it up nicely: "Pick very fine grained tasks".
  (It's speaking about scheduling software but can apply to anything really.)
* A reward system can work well.
  Give yourself a treat when you meet a goal.
* An "agile" way of managing goals and interests is to take a day every month on your birthday to reflect, check in with yourself about how you are tracking against your goals and whether they are still relevant and meaningful.
* Good luck!
  This stuff is **hard** 😭

**Louise** and **Georgia** both extended **Patricia's** question to include, how do you find a good balance between the types of things you want to do?
**Louise** often finds herself wanting to shift between doing technical things, learning things and doing more collaborative/community-based things, and **Georgia** is wondering how to effectively switch between immediate goals and loger term exploratory or creative work.
It's easy to get stuck in one space, and there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day to work, do things you want to do, and do things to make sure you're happy and well 😩

**Konrad** extended the question again.
How do lab members decide which projects to work on when?
Should there be dedicated whole weeks or days, or subdivided days.
Or responding to current levels of motivation, most pressing collaborators, external or self imposed deadlines?
Is there any evidence for the efficacy of any of these approaches?

**Malvika** asked what each of us think of when we hear the phrase "Open Science".
There are so many different interpretations!

Some of the lab's answers:

* "Sharing your work, not hiding it, so long as it's safe and ethical to do so.
  (The safe bit is integral to this!!)"
* "Work 😂 I know that's not helpful but since they mentioned Open Access and data sharing as something libraries might do at university 10 years ago, I kind of build a career on various aspects of it."
* "Science with the intention to make your work as useful as possible to as many people as possible."
* "Transparent and accessible science: making the work auditable and documented in a way that anyone can extend.
  (A remarkably big ask 😬)"

**Yini** asked a related question.
She's been trying to translate _The Turing Way_ and she wasn't sure how to translate the concept of "Open Scholarship" into Chinese.
It is a very broad concept that includes open data, open notebook, open source software, citizen science and more.
She searched for the meaning of scholarship online and came up with three options!
A form of financial aid, the practice and method of scholars, or an international education program!

The lab answered that the second definition works best for this use of scholarship: the practice and method of scholars.
The reason that we "scholarship" rather than "science" is because there is lots of research that can be open but isn't science.
For example history, languages and politics are all research and are all scholarship, but aren't science.
**Kirstie** in particular is so excited that **Yini** is doing this work of translating _The Turing Way_!!
It's so exciting that people around the world will be able to learn in languages other than english ✨✨✨

**Yo** is looking for an "accountabilibuddy" for weekend and evening times, when she's doing research that's not related to her paid work.
She's worried about encouraging the unhealthy practice of people working in the evening or overworking, despite her own bad example 🤦‍♀.
The lab suggested asking folks who have a personal goal or resolutions that they want to get into their evening or weekend routine.
Your buddies don't have to be doing work, they could be reading, learning a language or exercising, but you can still incentivise and motivate each other.

**Ang** asked which platform anyone recommends for scientfic visualization in web browser?
He's seen that [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) seems a good chance as it can be established in pure Python, but deployment on a local server seems very expensive.
The lab agreed with him that javascript is the best choice for native visualisation, but the choice mostly depends on the type of data and type of visualisation?

## Our New Year's resolutions

**Kirstie**: My resolution is to be more considered and strategic about what I say yes to.
Particularly which talks/events I say yes to.
It's tough for me because I so enjoy giving talks, and I love the serendipity of bumping into people and sharing ideas, but I had a couple last year that were really poorly organised and I didn't think it was a good use of my time.
(Here's a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1212744490785681410?s=20) with a few more thoughts if you're interested.)

**Patricia**: 1) Do more exercise (cliche) by restarting some of my old hobbies that I loved and really miss doing: line dancing, hula hooping (when the weather is good enough to go into the garden) and some yoga to be flexible.
2) Related to that I want to find great communities and engage.
There are excellent local efforts made here in Edinburgh and I would like to support them by showing up regularly and applying some of the community building lessons from the book club in practice
3) Try and use alternatives to flying where possible even if that increases the travel time and might be more complex.
4) Watch one Mads Mikkelsen movie per month :joy:

**Malvika**: 1) Work mainly on _The Turing Way_ project.
Find alignment of this project with whatever event I agree to attend, and drop some time demanding tasks that are not directly related to _The Turing Way_.
2) Develop [OpenLifeSci](https://openlifesci.org) program towards its sustainability.
3) See more of London (find a dance+music school and a yoga studio).

**Louise**: Get better at finishing things I "promise" myself I will do.
I really need to stick to things once I start learning/making/doing them!

**Sarah**: 1) Move more.
I need to start looking after my body better.
2) Meet new people.
Despite the absolutely amazing person you all know and love (😉), I'm actually really shy and become a bit of a wallflower when confronted with new people.
I absolutely _hate_ going to things by myself, but it's difficult to avoid when most of your friends are in Leicester!
So I might push myself to do something different and talk to new people.
I'm part of a cross-stitching group on Facebook and might ask if anyone in there is in London and would like to meet up for an in-person stitching session (something known as a "Stitch and..." something that rhymes 😂).
I may even _dare_ to combine these two resolutions and go to a Swing Dance class.
The ladies that taught the class at the Turing Christmas party host a class in a church hall near Euston station on Wednesday nights.

**Yo**: I'm nonconformist and don't usually end up doing resolutions, but this comic spoke to me!

**Ang**: Trying to graduate my PhD and get a good job in China.
I hope that I could be a scientific researcher who can make some significant findings and also do some good popularization of science.

**Konrad**: Read 12 new books.
I keep rereading the same books to get to sleep, which probably is not the main reason for reading.

**Georgia**: My main resolution is to be more focussed and proactive.
I also have two personal learning goals - I want to learn the [saroban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soroban) and learn the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)! Anyone have any experience of these?

**Anastasia** I'm not sure how I feel about New Years 'resolutions' per se.
(Sometimes it feels like a productivity scam) but in general her goals are to try her best to stay grounded and be grateful for all the big and little things in the coming year.

These are all wonderful resolutions!
I'm excited to see how they all turn out 💖🌈🚀🌟
