Some amazing people I met in Turing. :)

## Bo Wang

Bo Wang is a visiting researcher at Turing and work with Professor Terry Lyons based at Oxford. 
I knew him because he is one of the organizers for Data science for mental health, an interest group aiming 
to lead to suitable clinical interventions for mental health by using multi-modal data. Bo is interested in 
developing clinically useful application for mental health by his expert in deep learning, also he’s working 
on some other projects. One project he’s working on is to analyze speech signals of individuals with mental 
disorders and try to help early identify clinical high risk individuals and aid the diagnose processing in psychiatry. 
He believe the key of such success could benefit more from novel methods integrated with prior knowledge and correct data,
and we could not only rely on the magic of AI. He’s very helpful and helped me with establishing the azure server and 
applying for credits, which is crucial for my work in Turing. Bo may come back to China one day and It would be exciting 
if I can collaborate with him on some project in the future. 

## Alex Campbell
Alex Campbell is an enrichment student at Turing and a PhD candidate at University of Cambridge. 
During Master period, Alex used deep leanring technology in financial data mining and then he switched 
his main interest into brain science and mental disorder. Kirstie introduced Alex to me as he is also 
worked on projects using neuroimaging data. One of his interests is to apply advanced AI models to data 
of human brain. Alex shared his recent work with me, where he used sophisticated machine learning model 
on a large-sample fMRI dataset to derive pathological brain circuits in autism. Alex is very helpful and 
really an expert at deep learnig models. He suggested me that I could use Siamese network to index maturity
in my project, which is very useful. 

## Anujan Poologaindran

Anujan Poologaindran was a neurosurgeon in Canada and worked on a magic surgery for treatment-resistant depression 
patients. His work is very meaningful and helps many depressive patients to start a new life without the risk of 
suicide. However, some of the patients tend to responde more to this surgery, which motiviated Anujan to further 
investigate this heterogeneity and thus pursue a PhD degree at University of Cambridge. He's project here is pretty 
cool and aims to identify some depression patients who could be most likely to respond for this surgery and find 
the optimal surgery target for each individual, which involving neurosurgery, neuroimaging and machine learning. 
He also believes that the curcuit of this surgery targets is a transdiagnostic biomarker, and thus could be useful 
to apply this surgery for all patients who had a strong desire of suicide. I really love his ideas and hope he can 
move this promising field forward and help with more patients.
